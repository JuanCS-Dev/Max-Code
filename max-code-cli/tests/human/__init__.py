"""
Human-Like Testing Suite - Real User Behavior Simulation

"Users are unpredictable, error-prone, and wonderfully chaotic."
— Every QA Engineer Ever

This suite simulates REAL human behavior:
- Typos and mistakes
- Changing their mind mid-task
- Vague/ambiguous requests
- Impatient behavior (spam, rapid requests)
- Copy-paste errors
- Mixed languages (PT/EN)
- Edge cases nobody thinks about

Goal: If the system survives these tests, it can survive real users.
